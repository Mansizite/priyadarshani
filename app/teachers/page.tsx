            Human values cannot be learnt from lectures or textbooks. Our teachers seek to impart values to students by practicing them first and setting an example.

            Their hearts are filled with love, and they lead the children under their care along the ideal path. They are ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of the pure-hearted children who rely on them for guidance.

          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Our teachers teach love to students only through love. If a pupil has a vice, they alone suffer. But if a teacher has a vice, thousands are affected.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Teachers can achieve any high ideal, provided they are cooperative, well-disciplined, and committed to service, sacrifice, and success.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Our teachers are not bound by working hours. They stay back when needed to clear doubts and help students complete their assignmentsâ€”because they see it as their duty.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            If teachers fulfill their roles with dedication, they can transform the nation. All student misconduct stems from poor guidance by both parents and teachers.
